# Traffic-Flow-Prediction
Artificial Intelligence Project 

The objective was to predict traffic patterns at different junctions to help manage congestion effectively.

I started by analyzing a dataset of traffic observations across four different junctions. To handle the temporal nature of the data, I used the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, which is well-suited for time-series prediction. The model was built using Python with libraries like TensorFlow and Sklearn for machine learning, and Pandas for data preprocessing.

The project involved multiple steps. First, I preprocessed the data by cleaning it and scaling the features to ensure compatibility with the LSTM model. I then trained the model to identify patterns and trends in the traffic data. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), and I visualized the results to show predicted versus actual traffic flow over time.

One of the challenges was dealing with missing data and anomalies in the dataset. To address this, I implemented data imputation techniques and ensured the data was smoothed before feeding it into the model.

This project helped me enhance my skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, and time-series analysis. It also demonstrated how predictive analytics can be used to address real-world problems like traffic management."
